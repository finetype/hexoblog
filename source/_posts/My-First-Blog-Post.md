## It was several years ago that I first envisioned
starting this blog.

I was in school. I finished an assignment early, and knew I'd
be looking for jobs soon. So I used my extra day to throw together the first draft of [my personal site](http://kylebaker.io).

I called the repo "Portfolio", intending for it to eventually host a curated, animated, interactive display of some projects of mine. As of this moment, that's still the plan--still another thing I haven't gotten to.

Another goal? have a blog on a subdomain of my site.

I got as far as getting the host domain, establishing a look I liked, searching for hours for the perfect banner picture (I think it's pretty nice, don't you? Still not perfectly satisfied, though perhaps by the time you read this it will finally be 'perfect'), adding some cute animation and basic first draft.

And that's how it sat. For years.

My skill at coding quickly improved, as is the case for beginners, and I cringed to think about someone opening up the console and seeing my crude code from back then.
I never got around to adding the project pages.
Never got around to adding that blog. 

But I often got compliments on it. It worked. It was pretty enough.

Still, it's always harder to satisfy yourself...

But why did I stop? Why did I hesitate to take the next steps? I would have said I never found the time, but that simply isn't true. I waste time constantly. In reality, I was avoiding it.

Why?

Back then, the idea of installing and using some open source blog software was a tiny bit intimidating. So was the idea of figuring out subdomains, which I'd never set up before (I'd barely dealt with DNS records, they made me uneasy). Like so many things, I knew they weren't that hard, and well within my capability, but there was a subtle, lurking hesitation that kept me from just diving in.

**I know what it was now**. It was a self-protection mechanism that had never served me well, but was developed early in childhood to protect me. And learning to deal with it has been a life-long task.

I read an article that changed my life a few years ago in Psychology today. It described my childhood perfectly, and suddenly I knew myself better than I had before. The crux was this:

When you're raised being praised for your intelligence, generally for picking up on something instantly and easily, you internalize that this is the source of your value. Unfortunately, you thus learn the corrolary: that anything you struggle with undermines your value.

Depending on other factors in your childhood, this can cause varying levels of severity of problems. For me, it led to a start in life as a chronic underachiever, starting from the first time I didn't get straight-A's (I remember that first 89, still, bitterly). Because, if you don't care, and barely try, then you don't risk revealing the limits of your abilities.

Programming can be a source of therapy for this problem, if you let it be. And the therapy is to start facing your shortcomings through hard work.

A programmer, a good one, faces new and difficult things all day. And if you approach programming with the attitude that there are far more brilliant people than you creating the tools you relying on every day, then you can learn to relax. You can just be you, wherever you are.

But it's a process, still. It's a regular desensitization.

Over time, the lesson you learn is that _hard work_ is necessary _even for smart people_.

Even beginning programming was delayed by me for ten years, because I was afraid to struggle at it. Programming is like learning an alien tongue--the language of logic and the universe, a different dialect of math. Wrapping your head comfortably around higher-order functions takes a bit.

When I finally started it, I was a fish in water. But I also was a bird learning to fly who had never bothered trying for ten years.

Experiencing failure... It's a beautiful lesson I've encountered in many domains in life. It's a constant source of education. In Go, in Judo, in BJJ, in programming, in relationships. To embrace it and learn from it, rather than reject it--to see in your failure the perfectly acceptable shortcomings that can be _developed_ and _grown_ and _improved_, and not inalienable, unalterable limitations.

This is one of my life's journeys. I think it's something a lot of intelligent kids were cursed with, and I think it's something a lot of programmers deal with.

Back to work. Hopefully, by the time you read this, I'll have finished that portfolio page after all. ;)
